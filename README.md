### What I learned


This was a simple exercise to warm up my skills with HTML and CSS again, and my first time using global CSS variables.


```css
   :root {
    background-color: hsl(233, 47%, 7%);
    --card-bg: hsl(244, 38%, 16%);
    --accent: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
    --paragraph-color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
    --stat-name-color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.6)
}
```
